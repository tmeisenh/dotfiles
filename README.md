dotfiles
========
My `$HOME`.  Probably of no use to anyone else.

I've been using this shell for over twenty years and other parts in this repo for over fifteen years (as of 2021).  This is why everything is home rolled vs using something like `oh-my-zsh` or `zpresto`.

I started out using GNU/Linux around 2000/2001 (Slackware, Gentoo, Debian and Debian-based systems) and after a few years of that I switched over to FreeBSD.  That lasted a couple of years until I moved to OSX/MacOS around 2005.  I still prefer FreeBSD but MacOS is more practical for "life" reasons.

In 2006 I decided to store my `$HOME` under `subversion` (if you remember that!).  This repo goes back to 2009 when I migrated from a corrupted `subversion` repo to `git`.

For posterity/posterior, prior to the mono repo the state of the world was:
