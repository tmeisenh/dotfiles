# dotfiles

My `$HOME`. Probably of no use to anyone else.

I've been using the zsh shell since the early 2000s and this is why everything is home rolled vs using something like `oh-my-zsh` or `zpresto`. My vim settings have ranged from simple setup to a full blown IDE replacement to currently a simple setup for quick edits.

I started out using GNU/Linux in 2000 (Slackware, Gentoo, Debian and Debian-based systems) and after a few years of that I switched over to FreeBSD. That lasted a couple of years until I moved to OSX/MacOS around 2005. I still prefer FreeBSD but MacOS is more practical for "life" reasons. Nowadays, I'd probably just use Debian if I wasn't so invested in the Apple ecosystem.

In 2006 I decided to store my `$HOME` under `subversion` (if you remember that!). This repo goes back to 2009 when I migrated from a corrupted `subversion` repo to `git`.

For posterity, prior to the mono repo the state of the world was:
